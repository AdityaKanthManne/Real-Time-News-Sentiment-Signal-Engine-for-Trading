# 📰 Real-Time News Sentiment Signal Engine for Trading

This project builds an end-to-end real-time sentiment analysis engine for financial news and social media feeds, transforming headlines and tweets into actionable trading signals. The model evaluates the sentiment and triggers alerts or strategy decisions based on changing market tone.

---

## 📌 Key Features

- **Live News Feed Aggregation** from sources like Twitter, Bloomberg headlines, and NewsAPI.
- **Financial Sentiment Classification** using fine-tuned models like FinBERT or GPT-4.
- **Signal Generation Engine** that computes rolling sentiment scores and change deltas to identify trading opportunities.
- **Modular Pipeline**: Data ingestion → Preprocessing → Sentiment scoring → Signal logic → Output triggers.
- **Backtest Compatibility**: Signal outputs are structured for use in backtesting platforms like Backtrader or Zipline.

## 🧠 Use Case

Quant funds, prop trading firms, and retail traders increasingly use alternative data such as real-time sentiment to detect early market shifts and alpha opportunities. This project focuses on:
- Detecting shifts in sentiment across major tickers.
- Producing tradeable signals on high-impact news.
- Aligning with volatility spikes or institutional flows.
