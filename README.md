# 📰 Real-Time News Sentiment Signal Engine for Trading

This project builds a real-time sentiment analysis engine for financial news and social media feeds, transforming headlines and tweets into actionable trading signals. It uses free APIs, open-source libraries, and publicly accessible models to remain fully cost-effective and deployable by individual developers or quant teams.
